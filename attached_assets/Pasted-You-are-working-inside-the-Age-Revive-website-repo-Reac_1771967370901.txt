You are working inside the Age Revive website repo (React + Vite). Build a brand-new page at route: /science

This is a high-stakes credibility page. It must improve:
- SEO and LLM SEO (clean semantic structure, entity-rich copy, internal linking, glossary, references)
- Conversion (clear protocol architecture, product CTAs, trust markers)
- Trust (testing, dosing rationale, transparent limitations, references, disclaimers)

NON-NEGOTIABLES
- Do not change existing global styling, header, footer, or cart logic.
- This task is additive: create new page + minimal new CSS scoped to the page.
- Keep tone: clinical, calm, premium. No hype. No medical claims.
- Avoid disease claims (no diagnose/treat/cure/prevent).
- Keep copy structure/function and evidence-focused.
- No em dashes in copy (do not use the “—” character).
- Use semantic HTML (H1 once, logical H2/H3), accessible accordion, and tables with captions.
- Add JSON-LD (WebPage + BreadcrumbList + FAQPage).
- Add internal links to the 3 products using descriptive anchor text.

DESIGN + LAYOUT SPEC (match existing design language)
- Background: deep navy gradient with subtle teal glow
- Typography: uppercase spaced section labels and large display headlines (match existing PDP feel)
- Components: cards with faint borders, rounded corners, soft shadows, teal accents, checklist rows
- Layout:
  1) Hero with trust markers + CTA
  2) Sticky Table of Contents (desktop) + horizontal TOC pills (mobile)
  3) Protocol Architecture (3 layers) with product cards and CTAs
  4) Our Standards (Dose, Delivery, Mechanism, Transparency, Testing)
  5) Deep Dives:
     - NAD+ and cellular energy metabolism (CELLUNAD+)
     - Gut–mitochondria axis: mitophagy + butyrate (CELLUBIOME)
     - Autophagy + senescence research compounds (CELLUNOVA)
  6) Delivery Matters (enteric protection and why it exists)
  7) Quality and Testing (cGMP, third-party, contaminants, COA policy)
  8) Evidence and Dosing Tables (per product)
  9) Glossary (DL list)
  10) FAQ (accordion)
  11) References (external links to primary sources)
  12) Final CTA section (“Build your protocol”)

IMPLEMENTATION
Create these new files exactly:

1) src/science/scienceContent.ts
2) src/styles/science.css
3) src/pages/SciencePage.tsx

Then wire route:
4) Update src/App.tsx (or wherever routes are defined) to add:
   <Route path="/science" element={<SciencePage />} />

Then add a nav link to Science:
5) In your header/menu component (search for nav items “Shop”, “Products”, etc.), add:
   <Link to="/science">Science</Link>
Do not change layout, just add the link.
