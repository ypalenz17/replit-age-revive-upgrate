You are a senior CRO strategist and premium longevity UX designer.

We are optimizing two sections on the CELLUBIOME PDP:

“Why Enteric Delivery Matters”

“Benefits That Build” (Results Over Time)

Goals:

Increase purchase confidence

Reinforce formulation superiority

Improve semantic richness for LLM indexing

Maintain clinical luxury tone

Fix vertical spacing rhythm

Avoid generic supplement language

No fluff

No hype

No wellness clichés

Do NOT redesign the entire layout.
Refine hierarchy, spacing, and content only.

SECTION 1 — WHY ENTERIC DELIVERY MATTERS
1️⃣ Structural Adjustments

Reduce excessive vertical padding.

Target spacing:

Top padding: 88px desktop / 64px mobile

Bottom padding: 104px desktop / 72px mobile

Max text width: 620px

Centered layout remains

Reduce excessive empty space above the flask icon.

Icon size reduce by 10%.

2️⃣ Replace Body Copy With This (LLM Optimized + Conversion Focused)
<p>
<strong>Urolithin A</strong> and <strong>Tributyrin</strong> must reach the small intestine intact to activate <strong>mitophagy</strong> pathways and deliver bioavailable <strong>butyrate</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Standard capsules can degrade in stomach acid. CELLUBIOME uses enteric delivery to protect active compounds until they reach the intestinal environment where absorption and barrier support occur.
</p>

<p class="micro-proof">
Targeted intestinal release enhances biological efficacy and supports gut–mitochondria signaling stability.
</p>

Requirements:

Keep tone clinical.

No marketing exaggeration.

Natural inclusion of:

Urolithin A

Tributyrin

Mitophagy

Butyrate

Intestinal absorption

Enteric delivery

SECTION 2 — RESULTS OVER TIME

This section is important for conversion psychology.

Right now it feels like:
Generic timeline UI.

We need:
Progression.
Momentum.
Authority.

1️⃣ Padding & Layout Fix

Reduce top padding slightly.
Increase spacing between headline and time selectors.

Target:

Top padding: 96px

Bottom padding: 120px

Timeline toggle spacing: 40px from headline

2️⃣ Rewrite Headline Block

Replace:

“BENEFITS THAT BUILD”

With:

<h2>Biological Improvements Over Time</h2>

Keep:
RESULTS OVER TIME as eyebrow label.

Replace subline with:

<p class="subhead">
What consistent cellular support may look like.*
</p>

Less consumer-y. More clinical.

3️⃣ Rewrite Timeline Copy (Conversion + Authority)
2 WEEKS

Replace content with:

<ul>
<li>Early digestive comfort improvements*</li>
<li>Butyrate begins supporting intestinal barrier cells*</li>
<li>Initial cellular recycling support via mitophagy activation*</li>
</ul>
4 WEEKS
<ul>
<li>Improved gut barrier resilience*</li>
<li>More consistent mitochondrial energy efficiency*</li>
<li>Reduction in digestive variability*</li>
</ul>
8 WEEKS
<ul>
<li>Strengthened gut–mitochondria signaling*</li>
<li>Enhanced cellular renewal dynamics*</li>
<li>Greater systemic resilience*</li>
</ul>
3 MONTHS
<ul>
<li>Compounded support for mitochondrial function*</li>
<li>Sustained intestinal barrier integrity*</li>
<li>Long-term biological stability foundation*</li>
</ul>
4️⃣ UX Refinements

Remove overly heavy pill shadow on time toggles.

Reduce toggle contrast slightly.

Make active state refined, not neon.

Increase padding inside results card by 12%.

Soften card border opacity to 15%.

No glow effects.
No gradient gimmicks.
No bright teal saturation.

5️⃣ Psychological Reinforcement Line (Below Results Card)

Add subtle reinforcement:

<p class="confidence-line">
Designed for cumulative biological adaptation, not temporary symptom masking.
</p>

This increases perceived formulation depth.

FINAL VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before finishing:

Timeline reads scientific, not hype.

No “feel amazing” language.

No generic wellness phrases.

Clean semantic HTML.

Strong entity reinforcement for:

Urolithin A

Tributyrin

Mitophagy

Butyrate

Gut barrier

Mitochondrial function

Vertical spacing feels engineered.

No excessive empty air above icon sections.

End of instructions.
