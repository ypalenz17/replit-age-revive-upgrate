STOP changing the design system. We need a surgical fix pass across the Shop page.

Context:
After content updates, the agent drifted styles: colors changed, alignment/padding broke, the module selector rail is covering content, and some copy is too long causing layout issues. Fix ONLY wiring/layout/typography, and condense specific lines where needed.

GLOBAL NON-NEGOTIABLES (restore design system)
1) Color system:
- Keep background navy + subtle grid.
- Accent ONLY: the lighter accent blue/teal used for links/indices/underlines.
- Do NOT introduce new blues/teals for icons or random elements.
- Header icons must be consistent: white/low-contrast white, with accent only for tiny active indicators (cart count/underline). The hamburger icon must NOT become teal.

2) Typography system:
- Labels and micro text must be readable (no ghost text).
- Maintain consistent left alignment within sections (no drifting margins).
- No truncated text, no accidental missing spaces (e.g., “CRASH.IT”).

3) Layout rules:
- No section may be covered by the bottom module selector rail.
- Every section must have proper bottom padding equal to rail height + safe area.

PHASE 1 — FIX THE BIG BROKEN THINGS (alignment + overlays)
A) Bottom Module Selector Rail (biggest issue)
Problem (seen in multiple screenshots): the CELLUNAD+/CELLUBIOME/CELLUNOVA rail is overlaying/covering content (headlines and body copy).
Fix:
- Make the rail height fixed and known (e.g., 64px).
- Add global content padding at the bottom of the page: padding-bottom = rail height + env(safe-area-inset-bottom) + 12px.
- Ensure the rail has a subtle top divider and does not visually collide with content.
- If the rail is position:fixed, ensure it NEVER overlaps text. If needed, increase bottom padding further.
- Optional: hide the rail when user reaches the footer CTA + footer area to avoid stacking UI.

B) Restore header icon colors (screenshot shows hamburger turned teal)
- Force header icons to use consistent white/white-80 styling.
- Only the cart count badge can have accent.

C) Fix spacing and alignment drift
- Ensure all sections share the same horizontal gutters (same px on mobile).
- Ensure section labels, headlines, and body copy align to the same left edge.
- Remove any accidental extra padding that makes sections drift right/left.

PHASE 2 — FIX COPY THAT IS TOO LONG OR BROKEN
Only change the specific lines below (do not rewrite everything).

1) Fix missing space typo (seen screenshot: “ENERGY DOESN’T CRASH.IT”):
Change to:
“ENERGY DOESN’T CRASH. IT QUIETLY LOSES EFFICIENCY.”

2) Shorten the micro line under the hero title (it’s too long/faint):
Current:
“Protocol: 2 capsules daily • System target: Cellular energy + repair pathways”
Replace with:
“Protocol: 2 caps daily • Target: energy + repair”

3) Shorten the short spec line under price area (if it wraps awkwardly):
Current:
“NR with redox and methylation cofactors. 8 actives, clinically dosed.”
Replace with:
“NR + cofactors. 8 actives. Clinically aligned.”

4) Telemetry intro paragraph (keep meaning but reduce to 2 lines max):
Current:
“If you can't measure change, you're guessing. Age Revive pairs protocol inputs with measurable feedback, so decisions get smarter over time.”
Replace with:
“If you can’t measure change, you’re guessing. Protocol inputs paired with measurable feedback.”

5) Compound specification reinforcement lines at bottom are too faint and feel misaligned:
Keep the two lines but ensure they are readable (increase contrast slightly) and aligned to the main text column.

PHASE 3 — SECTION-BY-SECTION FIXES BASED ON SCREENSHOTS
(1) Hero + product stage (first screenshot)
- Ensure “DAILY INPUT LAYER” label is readable (raise opacity slightly).
- Ensure hero block doesn’t feel over-spaced.
- Ensure bottle stage is centered and not pushed down by excessive padding.

(2) Benefit list + CTA block (second screenshot)
- Ensure the benefit lines aren’t cut by the header.
- Ensure “Ingredients | Evidence” row is aligned and readable.
- Keep one primary CTA only and ensure button color matches the established CTA style (no random new blue).

(3) “Why daily input matters” section (second screenshot)
- Fix the “CRASH. IT” typo.
- Ensure headline line-breaks are clean and not covered by the bottom rail.

(4) “What it supports” and Telemetry transition (third screenshot)
- Reduce dead space between “What it supports” and Telemetry.
- Ensure Telemetry indices (01/02/03) align perfectly.
- Ensure the bottom rail does not cover the 03 line.

(5) “Formulation standards” + “Compound specification” header (fourth screenshot)
- Ensure section label contrast is consistent and not too faint.
- Ensure “No proprietary formulations.” line aligns correctly and doesn’t float awkwardly.
- Ensure the rail does not overlap the next section header.

(6) Ingredient list with “References” links (fifth screenshot)
- Keep “References” using the lighter accent blue with adequate contrast.
- Ensure “References” sits consistently under each compound (same spacing).
- Ensure hamburger icon is not teal.

(7) Protocol arc + final CTA + footer (sixth/seventh screenshots)
- Ensure the bottom rail does not cover “Protocol Arc” headline.
- Ensure the final CTA section is aligned and the primary CTA uses the correct system button style (not a random solid blue block).
- Ensure footer columns are aligned and readable.
- Optionally hide the bottom rail when footer is in view.

DELIVERABLE
- Implement these fixes with minimal code changes.
- List files edited.
- Confirm tested on iPhone width 375px and 390px.
- Confirm: no content is covered by the bottom module selector rail anywhere on the page.
