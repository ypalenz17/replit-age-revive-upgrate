You are a senior luxury UI designer + frontend engineer.

MISSION:
Update the DESKTOP homepage UI to feel like a premium longevity/healthspan company (clinical luxury). 
Improve perceived valuation without changing the brand identity.

HARD CONSTRAINTS:
- Do NOT change product names.
- Do NOT change routing or page structure.
- Do NOT add new sections or remove existing sections.
- Do NOT introduce new font families (no serif imports).
- Keep the existing navy + teal palette, but reduce neon/glow.
- Mobile must remain unchanged. Desktop-only changes (lg+).
- Avoid heavy new dependencies. Use existing stack (Tailwind/React). If GSAP isn’t already installed, don’t add it.

SCOPE (phase 1 only):
Implement these improvements only on the Homepage HERO and NAV:

1) HERO composition (desktop):
- Convert hero to a deliberate 12-col grid on lg+.
- Left column: keep all existing copy and CTAs (no copy changes).
- Right column: add a premium abstract hero visual (use the selected Nano image asset: the glass orb/axis style) as the hero object.
  - If the asset is not in the repo, add it to assets and import it.
  - The visual should be large, centered-right, with generous negative space.
  - No bottle layering for now.

2) Reduce “gamer neon” background:
- Keep the grid, but reduce glow intensity and saturation on desktop hero only.
- Add a subtle vignette/gradient depth behind the hero (very restrained).
- No particles, no HUD, no smoke video, no animated backgrounds in this phase.

3) CTA styling refinement:
- Remove any font-mono usage from hero buttons and primary interactive elements on homepage.
- Keep the same CTA layout and wording.
- Slightly refine button padding/height and border weight on desktop for a more premium feel.
- Hover states should be subtle (opacity/border shift), not flashy.

4) Spacing rhythm:
- Increase hero vertical padding on desktop only (lg+), so the hero breathes.
- Improve spacing between headline/subhead/CTAs/proof row to feel editorial.
- Do not change mobile spacing.

5) Nav legibility:
- Increase nav text contrast slightly on desktop (e.g., from white/55 to white/70 range), but keep it elegant.
- No layout changes to nav.

DELIVERABLES:
- Provide the exact files changed.
- Provide before/after notes for each change.
- Confirm mobile is unchanged.
- Do not touch any other sections beyond HERO + NAV in this phase.
