ROLE: You are operating at elite design standards. This is not a redesign. This is a surgical refinement pass to elevate the Shop page from premium DTC to institutional biotech.

Objective:
Increase perceived authority, contrast control, and structural inevitability.
Remove remaining mid-tier cues.
Tighten rhythm.
Refine hierarchy.
Improve transitions.

DO NOT:
- Add new components.
- Add heavy effects.
- Add more glow.
- Reintroduce cards.
- Add trendy UI.
- Make it busier.

PHASE 1 — CONTRAST CONTROL (LEGIBILITY + AUTHORITY)

1) Reduce grid interference in content zones by ~20%.
   - Slightly darken background behind text-heavy sections.
   - Do NOT remove grid entirely.
   - The grid should support, not compete.

2) Increase contrast hierarchy:
   - Section labels (e.g., FORMULATION STANDARDS) increase opacity slightly.
   - Titles slightly brighter.
   - Body copy slightly more legible (text-white/75–80).
   - Metadata slightly dimmer (text-white/55–60).

3) Increase weight of structural numbers (01–04) slightly.
   - They must feel architectural.
   - Not decorative.

PHASE 2 — VERTICAL RHYTHM DISCIPLINE

4) Refine spacing rhythm:
   - Slightly tighter spacing between title and description.
   - Slightly more separation between sections.
   - Avoid equal vertical spacing everywhere.
   - Introduce subtle hierarchy through spacing contrast.

5) Improve transition from “Formulation Standards” to next headline.
   - Add slightly more breathing room before “Every dose, fully disclosed.”
   - Make the transition feel intentional, not stacked.

PHASE 3 — ELIMINATE APP ENERGY

6) Refine product selector tabs:
   - Slightly reduce underline brightness.
   - Make active state feel deliberate, not neon.
   - Maintain thin rail system.

7) Refine CTA:
   - Slightly reduce button height by 4–6px.
   - Reduce gradient intensity slightly.
   - Keep it dominant but restrained.
   - It should feel precise, not flashy.

PHASE 4 — TYPOGRAPHIC REFINEMENT

8) Tighten hero description language to eliminate any remaining marketing softness.
   - Keep declarative tone.
   - Remove filler words.
   - Reduce sentence length where possible.

9) Remove periods in micro descriptive lines where cleaner.
   - Keep tone clinical, not conversational.

PHASE 5 — FINAL ALIGNMENT CHECK

10) Perform strict alignment audit:
   - Left edges must align across all modules.
   - Dividers must match content width.
   - No floating misalignments.
   - No micro drift.

ACCEPTANCE TEST:

The page should feel:
- Engineered
- Institutional
- Inevitable
- Structured
- Confident

It must NOT feel:
- Startup-y
- Trendy
- App-like
- SaaS component-based
- Influencer wellness

Deliver:
- List of refined adjustments made.
- Confirmation of mobile check at 375px and 390px.
- Confirmation that no new design patterns were introduced.
