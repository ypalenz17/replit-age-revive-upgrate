Deep refinement pass on the protocol modules (CELLUNAD+, CELLUBIOME, CELLUNOVA). The layout is clean but still feels generic/component-library. Do not redesign everything. Keep the structure, but upgrade composition, hierarchy, and “engineered luxury” details.

Goals:
1) Make bottle + panel feel like one staged product module.
2) Reduce “terminal UI” typography and improve readability.
3) Increase perceived cost through lighting, masking, and spacing rhythm.
4) Introduce controlled per-protocol identity without breaking consistency.

Required changes:

A) Stage composition (tie bottle to panel)
- Add a shared lighting system:
  - radial backlight behind bottle
  - subtle contact shadow under bottle (weight, not glow)
  - thin top-edge highlight on the panel that visually connects to the bottle
- The lighting must be subtle and consistent across products.

B) Grid masking behind panel
- The grid is bleeding through and adding noise.
- Increase panel separation by one of:
  - slightly higher panel opacity (still glass)
  - or a scrim layer inside panel (bg-white/6 + blur)
  - or a dedicated “panel backdrop” element that softens grid behind it
- The panel must feel like a distinct surface.

C) Typography system cleanup
- Use mono + wide tracking ONLY for the micro label line at the top.
- Product name: strongest.
- Benefit: readable sans, slightly narrower line length on mobile (avoid awkward wraps).
- Outcomes: readable sans (not mono), tight spacing.
- Dosage/supply: quieter metadata (text-white/55, tracking normal).

D) Hierarchy and spacing rhythm
- Stop even spacing. Use deliberate rhythm:
  - tight: micro label -> title
  - medium: title -> benefit
  - larger: benefit -> outcomes
  - medium: outcomes -> metadata
  - larger: metadata -> CTA
- Reduce panel overall height by tightening gaps.

E) Outcomes block
- Standardize outcomes:
  - max 3 items
  - single column
  - tighter spacing
  - brighter check icons
  - text-white/70

F) CTA system (engineered, not bland)
- Define a consistent button system:
  - Primary: dark glass + subtle inner highlight + thin teal edge line (not purple)
  - Secondary: outline glass, dimmer
  - Both same height, not oversized
- Remove any leftover purple CTA styling.

G) Controlled per-protocol identity
- Add a subtle per-product accent detail:
  - a tiny accent line, icon, or edge tint in the panel top highlight
  - keep it restrained (no loud gradients)
- Keep layout identical, only accent changes.

Acceptance tests:
- Module no longer reads “template card.” It reads “staged product system.”
- Grid is not visually competing inside the panel.
- Typography is readable and less terminal-like.
- CTAs feel engineered and premium.
- Each product feels distinct but still part of one system.

Deliverable:
- Implement changes and list files edited.
- Provide before/after notes on: lighting system, panel masking, typography rules, button system.
