TASK: Redesign the “4 standards” area (currently shown as 01/02/03/04 rounded chips with truncated text like “3RD PARTY TEST…”) into a premium, structured “Formulation Standards” block.

GOAL:
- Remove the generic SaaS chip/tag look.
- Remove ellipses/truncation completely.
- Make it feel like engineered standards: dense, authoritative, architectural.

SCOPE:
- Only redesign the standards block (the 4 items).
- Do not change other sections on the page.
- Keep the existing brand palette (navy + off-white + teal accent).
- No new heavy effects (no big glows, no giant blur cards).

REMOVE:
- Rounded pill containers for each item.
- Any “…” truncation.
- Any grid-of-chips layout.
- Any large glass card wrapping the whole thing (unless it’s extremely subtle and not rounded).

REPLACE WITH THIS EXACT COPY (verbatim):
01  THIRD-PARTY TESTED
Independent lab verification.

02  STANDARDIZED ACTIVES
Precise concentration, no variability.

03  ENTERIC DELIVERY
Targeted absorption.

04  QUALITY CONTROL
Multi-stage review process.

LAYOUT (MOBILE FIRST):
- Vertical stack of 4 rows (not 2x2).
- Each row is a compact “module line item”:
  - Left: the index number (01, 02, 03, 04).
  - Right: the title + description stacked.
- Add a thin divider between rows (border-white/10).
- Tight spacing. No airy padding.

TYPOGRAPHY + HIERARCHY:
1) Index number (01/02/03/04)
- Slightly larger than body text.
- Use tabular numbers if available (or a mono style ONLY for the number).
- Color: subtle teal accent (not bright neon).
- Example intent: “system index,” not decoration.

2) Title (THIRD-PARTY TESTED, etc.)
- Uppercase.
- Strongest text in the block after the number.
- Color: text-white/85 to text-white/90.
- Tracking: slight (NOT excessive).
- Keep line height tight.

3) Description (Independent lab verification.)
- Sentence case exactly as provided.
- Smaller than title.
- Color: text-white/60 to text-white/70.
- Tight line height, 1 line preferred.

COMPONENT STYLE RULES:
- No rounded boxes per item.
- No pills.
- No truncation.
- No big background container that makes it feel like a card UI component.
- If you add a background behind the whole standards block, it must be extremely subtle:
  - bg-white/3 to bg-white/5 max
  - border-white/10
  - rounded-lg only (not rounded-2xl)
  - padding small (px-4 py-3)
  - The block must still read like a structured list, not a “card.”

SPACING TARGETS (so it feels expensive, not template):
- Between rows: 14–18px total vertical breathing room including divider.
- Title to description: 4–6px.
- Whole block should be compact enough to read in 2 seconds.

RESPONSIVE:
- Mobile (<= 420px): index + text stack should align cleanly, no wrapping chaos.
- Desktop: keep the same vertical structure or optionally switch to 2 columns ONLY if it still reads like a standards panel (but mobile is priority).

ACCEPTANCE TESTS:
- No “…” anywhere.
- All four titles fully visible on iPhone width.
- Block feels like “Formulation Standards” (architectural) not UI tags.
- Readable at a glance: strong title contrast, softer descriptions.
- Dividers are subtle and consistent.

DELIVERABLE:
- Implement the redesign in the code.
- Tell me the exact file(s) you edited and where this block lives (component name).
- Confirm you checked it at 375px and 390px widths.
