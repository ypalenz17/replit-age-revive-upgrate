PHASE 2: VISUAL DESIGN UPGRADE (make it feel expensive)
This phase starts ONLY after Phase 1 is clean.

A) FIX THE “PILL PROBLEM” (engineered corners)
- Remove excessive rounded-full usage across buttons, nav containers, and ingredient tags.
- Establish a consistent radius system:
  - Buttons and small UI: rounded-md or rounded-lg
  - Cards: rounded-xl
  - Sheets/modals: rounded-2xl
- Use rounded-full only for tiny circular dots or badges, not major components.

B) CONTRAST + LUMINOSITY (premium legibility)
- Ingredient tags currently look muddy (dark text on dark background).
- Update tag styling pattern to: translucent background + luminous text + subtle border.
  Example: bg-[accent]/12 text-white/80 border border-white/10
- Raise low-opacity text (text-white/30 and /40) to at least text-white/60 where it matters (footer, pillar microcopy, ingredient lines).

C) GROUND THE PRODUCT RENDERS (stop “floating asset syndrome”)
- Add an ambient colored shadow behind each product image:
  - subtle drop-shadow plus a radial backlight glow behind the jar
  - per-product accent tint (teal, violet, blue)
- Add a faint shadow under the jar to anchor it to the card.

D) PUSH THE GRID BACK (subtlety)
- Reduce grid opacity (it is competing with text and cards).
- Target: grid should be felt, not read. Cut its opacity roughly in half.
- Add atmospheric depth: radial gradients behind key sections so the grid recedes naturally.

E) TYPOGRAPHY REFINEMENT (less forced, more editorial)
- The heavy italics on “Gut Resilience.” and “Systems Axis.” feel forced.
- Remove forced italics on large headline lines.
- Create hierarchy using color and opacity instead:
  - Primary headline: text-white
  - Secondary headline: text-white/65 to /75
- Reduce tracking on small all-caps labels and ensure minimum readable size on mobile.

F) GLASS + EDGE LIGHTING (expensive UI, not gaming)
- Upgrade cards with:
  - subtle internal gradient (top slightly lighter)
  - faint glass blur where appropriate (backdrop-filter) with fallbacks
  - thin edge highlight border (border-white/10) plus a very subtle accent edge on active/hover

G) MOTION (cinematic, subtle)
- Add staggered reveal animations per section (fade + translateY 12-20px) with smooth easing:
  cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)
- Add very subtle parallax on the background grid (1-2% movement).
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion. No motion for users who opt out.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (Tailwind)
- Create a small “design tokens” layer in tailwind.config (borderRadius scale, shadows, accent colors).
- Create reusable components:
  - Button (primary/secondary/ghost)
  - Tag/Pill (but squared corners)
  - Card shell (glass + border + gradient)
  - SectionHeading
- Replace one-off class chaos with consistent component styling.

ACCEPTANCE TESTS (must pass)
- No dev text, no broken image icons, no empty Journal container.
- Hero communicates what is sold in 5 seconds and CTA says “Shop”.
- Product cards have clear buttons and do not rely on tiny “VIEW →”.
- Ingredient tags are readable and high contrast.
- Grid is subtle and does not fight content.
- Product jars feel grounded (ambient glow + shadow).
- 6 Pillars is interactive (accordion or swipe), not endless scroll.
- Overall page looks engineered-luxury, not gaming UI.

DELIVERABLE
- Implement changes and list the files modified.
- Provide before/after notes describing the design system (radius, typography, shadows, motion).
