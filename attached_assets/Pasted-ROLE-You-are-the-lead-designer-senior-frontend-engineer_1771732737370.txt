ROLE: You are the lead designer + senior frontend engineer. Apply the exact design system + UX improvements we implemented on the Home page to the Shop page. This is not a new design. This is replication + consistency. Do not invent new UI patterns.

NON-NEGOTIABLES
- NO redesign thrash. Use the Home page as source-of-truth for spacing, typography, contrast, corners, and “engineered luxury” style.
- Remove all SaaS/chip/accordion/2012 DTC patterns from Shop.
- No rounded-full for major UI. Engineered corners only.
- No truncated labels with “…”.
- No low-contrast ghost text that becomes unreadable on mobile.
- No “random extra air”. Density and rhythm must match Home.
- Do not invent certifications/claims. Use the copy we already have, only change styling and layout. If any proof claims exist, keep them accurate.

PHASE 1 — STRUCTURE + UX (make it correct before pretty)
1) SHOP PAGE LAYOUT CONSISTENCY
- Use the same header treatment as Home (glass control strip, minimal, engineered).
- Same max-width container rules, same padding, same section spacing rhythm.
- Fix any dead zones between sections (target 48–64px between major blocks on mobile).

2) CTA LANGUAGE + HIERARCHY
- Primary actions must be commerce-native and consistent with Home:
  - Primary: “Shop Protocol Stack” or “Shop the System”
  - Secondary: “Explore Individual Protocols” (as a link, not a big second button)
- No purple primary CTAs. Teal system accent is primary. Secondary stays glass/outline.

3) PRODUCT CARD SYSTEM (CRITICAL)
- Replace any generic product tiles with the Home-approved “Product Stage + Panel” module:
  - Large bottle/jar above
  - Panel underneath (rounded consistently on all corners)
  - Clear hierarchy: micro label -> product name -> 1-line benefit -> outcomes -> dosage/supply -> CTA(s)
  - No overlap hacks that cover text. If bottle sits above panel, keep consistent gap and ensure no collision.
- CTAs in cards:
  - Two stacked buttons (no weird + square button):
    - Primary: View Protocol
    - Secondary: Add to Stack (or Add to Cart if cart exists)
  - Button height 44–48px on mobile, engineered corners (rounded-lg), tight gaps.

4) STANDARDS / PROOF SECTION
- Remove chip-grid/rounded tag UI.
- Use the Home-approved “Standards list” layout (architectural list):
  01 THIRD-PARTY TESTED
     Independent lab verification
  02 STANDARDIZED ACTIVES
     Precise concentration, no variability
  03 ENTERIC DELIVERY
     Targeted absorption
  04 QUALITY CONTROL
     Multi-stage review process
- Alignment rules:
  - Clean left edge alignment with surrounding content
  - Dividers align to the text block width (not wider)
  - Titles high contrast, descriptions slightly dimmer
  - No periods at end of descriptions if it makes tone cleaner (optional, but keep consistent)

5) 6 PILLARS / FRAMEWORK UI (IF PRESENT ON SHOP)
- If Shop includes any “framework” section, it must match the Home “6 pillars” redesign:
  - NO accordion cards
  - NO progress step bars
  - Present as stacked architectural layers:
    01 TITLE
    1–2 line explanation
    mechanisms | linked protocol →
  - Thin separators, strong titles, readable body text, integrated protocol link.

PHASE 2 — VISUAL SYSTEM + PREMIUM FINISH (engineered luxury)
Apply the Home design tokens and rules across Shop:

A) CORNERS / GEOMETRY
- Remove rounded-full from:
  - buttons, pills, tags, containers
- Radius system:
  - buttons/toggles: rounded-lg
  - panels/cards: rounded-2xl
  - sheets/modals: rounded-2xl
- Make corner treatment consistent (no rounded top with square bottom unless it’s intentionally docked; default is fully rounded).

B) CONTRAST + READABILITY
- Increase legibility to match Home:
  - Titles near-white
  - Body text white/70–80 (not white/40)
  - Metadata white/55–65
- Kill muddy dark-on-dark combos.
- Ensure small text never drops below readable on mobile.

C) GRID MANAGEMENT + PANEL MASKING
- Grid must be felt, not read.
- Where panels sit over grid, add subtle masking:
  - slightly higher panel opacity or scrim
  - keep glass feel but reduce interference behind text.

D) LIGHTING + DEPTH (SUBTLE)
- Use the same lighting logic as Home:
  - subtle radial backlight behind product bottle
  - faint contact shadow to ground object
  - subtle top-edge highlight on panels
- No neon glow. No “gaming RGB”.

E) TYPOGRAPHY RULES
- Mono/extra tracking only for micro labels or indices (01/02/03).
- Main copy uses normal tracking for readability.
- Tighten spacing rhythm: avoid equal gap everywhere.

PHASE 3 — POLISH + CONSISTENCY CHECKLIST (do not skip)
1) ALIGNMENT AUDIT
- Ensure:
  - left edges align consistently between sections
  - dividers line up with content blocks
  - indices and titles share consistent baselines
- Fix any “looks slightly off” spacing by snapping to an 8px spacing scale.

2) BUTTON SYSTEM CONSISTENCY
- Primary button always teal system style.
- Secondary always glass outline.
- No random third styles.

3) MOBILE OPTIMIZATION
- Verify at 375px and 390px:
  - no clipped text
  - no overflow
  - no truncation
  - no dead zones
  - tap targets >= 44px

4) REMOVE ANY PROTOTYPE ARTIFACTS
- No placeholder text visible
- No broken images
- No debug strings

DELIVERABLE
- Implement changes on Shop page.
- Tell me exactly which files were edited.
- Confirm you compared Home vs Shop side-by-side and matched:
  - corners
  - spacing rhythm
  - button styles
  - standards list styling
  - product module layout
  - typography/contrast
- Provide screenshots at 375px width for Shop page key sections after changes.
