We are rebuilding the “THE GUT–MITOCHONDRIA CONNECTION” section for CELLUBIOME.

Goals:

Increase conversion confidence

Improve semantic richness for LLM indexing

Strengthen biological authority

Maintain premium longevity positioning

Keep dark navy design system

Do NOT add generic marketing fluff

Do NOT change overall site architecture

Refine spacing, hierarchy, and semantic HTML only

1️⃣ STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS

Replace current section with this semantic structure:

<section aria-labelledby="gut-mito-heading" class="science-section">
  <div class="container">
    <p class="eyebrow">THE SCIENCE</p>

    <h2 id="gut-mito-heading">
      The Gut–Mitochondria Axis
    </h2>

    <div class="science-copy">
      <p>
        The gut barrier and mitochondrial function are biologically interconnected.
        Disruption in either system can amplify inflammation, impair cellular
        energy production, and accelerate biological aging.
      </p>

      <p>
        CELLUBIOME delivers clinically studied doses of Urolithin A and Tributyrin
        to support mitophagy activation, intestinal barrier integrity, and
        gut–mitochondria signaling resilience.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="axis-visual">
      <!-- existing visual container stays -->
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
2️⃣ CONVERSION OPTIMIZATION RULES

Add one reinforcing micro-proof line below paragraph 2:

<p class="micro-proof">
  Formulated to target both mitochondrial renewal and butyrate-mediated gut repair.
</p>

Add subtle CTA reinforcement under the diagram:

<p class="cta-support">
  Restore internal signal stability at the cellular level.
</p>

No buttons here. This is pre-CTA authority building.

3️⃣ LLM SEO ENHANCEMENT

We must naturally include these entities in body text:

Urolithin A

Tributyrin

Mitophagy

Intestinal barrier

Butyrate

Mitochondrial function

Gut–mitochondria axis

Biological aging

Do NOT keyword stuff.
Use clean scientific phrasing.

Add structured emphasis using <strong> on:

Urolithin A

Tributyrin

Mitophagy

Butyrate

4️⃣ SPACING + PADDING FIX

Adjust vertical rhythm:

Section top padding: 96px desktop / 72px mobile

Section bottom padding: 120px desktop / 88px mobile

Max-width text block: 640px

Line-height: 1.6

Remove excess empty vertical air above headline

The section must feel contained, not floating.

5️⃣ AXIS DIAGRAM REFINEMENT

Inside the visual container:

Reduce circle size by 12%

Add subtle vertical connector line from circle downward

Soften rectangle borders to 15% opacity

Remove heavy button feel

Increase inner padding of visual container

This should feel like a biological system blueprint, not clickable UI cards.

6️⃣ DESIGN CONSTRAINTS

Keep navy background

Keep teal accent

No amber

No glow effects

No heavy shadows

No glassmorphism

No marketing buzzwords

Tone must remain:
Clinical. Controlled. Intelligent.

7️⃣ FINAL VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before finishing:

Text reads authoritative, not salesy

Entities are present but natural

Section improves clarity

Padding is balanced top and bottom

Diagram feels connected, not floating

No generic phrases like “break the cycle”

No filler language

End of instructions.
