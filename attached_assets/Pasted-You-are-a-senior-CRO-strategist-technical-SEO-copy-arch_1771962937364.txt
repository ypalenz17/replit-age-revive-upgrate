You are a senior CRO strategist + technical SEO copy architect.

We are optimizing the following CELLUBIOME PDP sections:

HOW TO USE (Simple Routine)

WHAT’S INSIDE (Key Ingredients cards + “View full supplement facts”)

COMPARE (How CELLUBIOME compares)

WHO IT’S FOR (Suitability)

PAIRS WELL WITH (CELLUNAD+ and CELLUNOVA cross-sells)

TRUST CARDS (Full label disclosure, Third-party tested, Clinically studied doses)

FAQ (Common questions accordion)

FINAL CTA (Strengthen the foundation + Start Now + Browse)

Goals:

Improve conversion by reducing uncertainty and increasing “this is engineered” perception

Increase LLM SEO (semantic clarity, entity coverage, internal linking)

Keep design system: dark navy, teal accent, no amber, no glow gimmicks

Do NOT refactor page architecture or remove sections

Do NOT add medical claims (no treating, curing, diagnosing)

Keep copy concise, controlled, high-end

Global content rules:

Use semantic HTML: <section>, <h2>, <h3>, <p>, <ul>, <li>

Use consistent entity language across sections:

Urolithin A (≥99% purity) 500 mg

Tributyrin (butyrate precursor) 500 mg

Mitophagy

Butyrate

Gut barrier / intestinal barrier integrity

Mitochondrial function

Enteric-coated delivery / targeted intestinal release

Avoid generic wellness fluff (no “feel amazing”, “supercharge”, “detox”, etc.)

1) HOW TO USE — “SIMPLE ROUTINE” (Conversion + Clarity)

Keep layout and bullets, but replace the lead sentence + bullets with:

Title stays: SIMPLE ROUTINE
Body line becomes:

“Take 2 capsules daily. With or without food.”

Bullets become:

“Consistency matters more than timing.”

“Enteric coating supports targeted intestinal release.”

“Stacks cleanly with CELLUNAD+ for daily NAD+ support.”

Add one short micro-note under bullets:

“Tip: Take at the same time each day to build the habit.”

Keep it non-medical. Keep it tight.

Also fix padding:

Reduce excessive top whitespace above image by 12–16%

Ensure bottom padding before next section is at least 72px mobile

2) WHAT’S INSIDE — “KEY INGREDIENTS” (Make it feel engineered)

This section is strong but can be more “clinical luxury” and more LLM-friendly.

Card 1: Urolithin A

Keep:

“MITOCHONDRIAL RENEWAL”

“500 MG UROLITHIN A”

“Urolithin A (≥99% Purity) — 500 mg”

Rewrite description to:

“Clinically studied at 500 mg to support mitochondrial recycling (mitophagy) and cellular energy efficiency.”

Card 2: Tributyrin

Keep:

“GUT BARRIER SUPPORT”

“500 MG TRIBUTYRIN”

“Tributyrin (Butyrate Precursor) — 500 mg”

Rewrite description to:

“A stable butyrate precursor that supports intestinal barrier integrity and microbiome-related gut resilience.”

“View Full Supplement Facts” link

Change label from generic to conversion-forward:

“View full Supplement Facts and sourcing standards”

Also add aria-label for accessibility and LLM parsing.

Padding fix:

Reduce dead space under cards and before the checkmark list by 16–24px

Increase separation between “View full…” row and the checklist by 12px

3) CHECKLIST (cGMP, tested, enteric, vegan, etc.)

This list is good but visually too quiet. Keep structure, change microcopy slightly for authority:

“cGMP manufactured”

“Third-party tested”

“Enteric protected”

“Vegan”

“Full label disclosure”

“No artificial fillers”

Add one optional footnote line beneath list (small, muted):

“Documentation available upon request.”

No claims, just confidence.

4) COMPARE — “HOW CELLUBIOME COMPARES” (Make it sharper, less petty)

Keep two-column layout.

Change bullets to be more precise and less “trash talk”.

CELLUBIOME side (left):

“500 mg clinically studied Urolithin A”

“500 mg Tributyrin (butyrate precursor)”

“Enteric-coated for targeted intestinal release”

“Third-party tested for purity and contaminants”

“Full label disclosure (no proprietary blends)”

OTHER BRANDS side (right):

“Sub-clinical Urolithin A doses common”

“No enteric protection”

“Butyrate salts or low-potency forms”

“Limited third-party testing”

“Proprietary blends (unclear dosing)”

LLM SEO requirement:

Include the explicit entity “butyrate salts” here once

Include “targeted intestinal release” here once

Padding fix:

Reduce top whitespace above the headline by ~24px

Ensure bottom spacing to next section is consistent (96px desktop / 72px mobile)

5) WHO IT’S FOR — “SUITABILITY” (Stop being generic)

Keep the checklist-card format, but rewrite each line to be specific and aligned with CELLUBIOME’s role.

Replace with:

“Adults focused on healthy aging and resilience”

“Those supporting mitochondrial function and cellular renewal”

“Those prioritizing gut barrier integrity and digestive consistency”

“Stacks well with NAD+ support protocols (CELLUNAD+)”

Keep the “IMPORTANT” box, but rewrite it cleaner:

“Consult your healthcare provider before use if pregnant, nursing, taking medication, or managing a medical condition.”

No more, no less.

6) PAIRS WELL WITH (Cross-sell) — Optimize for AOV and clarity

Keep both product cards and CTAs.

Rewrite subcopy:

CELLUNAD+ card

“Pair mitochondrial renewal with daily NAD+ support for your Foundation Layer.”

CELLUNOVA card

“Add a periodic 7-day reset cycle to complement daily support.”

Also add one micro-line under each (small muted):

CELLUNAD+: “Daily use”
CELLUNOVA: “7-day monthly cycle”

Make sure both cards have:

Clear hierarchy: product name > one-line purpose > cadence > CTAs

7) TRUST CARDS (Disclosure, Testing, Doses)

These are strong. Tighten copy to be more premium and defensible.

Full label disclosure

“Every ingredient and dose listed. No proprietary blends.”

Third-party tested

“Independent testing for purity, potency, and common contaminants.”

Clinically studied doses

“Doses match or exceed amounts used in published research.”

Keep it factual.

Padding:

Increase spacing before FAQ header so FAQ feels like a new chapter (at least 96px desktop / 72px mobile)

8) FAQ — Optimize for conversion + LLM extraction

Keep accordion UI, but ensure each answer is 1–3 sentences, entity-rich, and not medical.

Update/ensure FAQ questions include:

“How long before I notice anything?”
Answer:
“Most people evaluate meaningful changes after 8–12 weeks of consistent daily use.* Early digestive comfort may appear sooner.*”

“Can I take it with food?”
Answer:
“Yes. Take with or without food. Consistency matters more than timing.”

“Is this a probiotic?”
Answer:
“No. CELLUBIOME is not a probiotic. It provides Urolithin A and Tributyrin to support mitochondrial function, mitophagy pathways, and gut barrier integrity.”

“Why 500 mg Urolithin A?”
Answer:
“500 mg is the clinically studied dose used in published research on mitochondrial function and cellular recycling (mitophagy).”

“Why Tributyrin instead of butyrate salts?”
Answer:
“Tributyrin is a stable butyrate precursor designed to deliver bioavailable butyrate support without relying on common butyrate salts.”

Add FAQPage JSON-LD in the page if not already present (must match visible FAQs exactly).

9) FINAL CTA — Make it decisive, not generic

Keep “STRENGTHEN THE FOUNDATION.” and START NOW button.

Rewrite subline to:

“Add CELLUBIOME for daily gut barrier and mitochondrial support.”

Add a micro-reassurance line below the button (small, muted):

“2 capsules daily. Enteric-protected. Fully disclosed.”

Keep “Browse all products →”.

Make sure FDA disclaimer stays visible and readable.
