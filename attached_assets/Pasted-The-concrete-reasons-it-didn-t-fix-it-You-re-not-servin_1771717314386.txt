The concrete reasons it didn’t fix it

You’re not serving the React build at all
Your / and /shop responses are not a React shell, they’re a full page of text content. That means Express is responding with a string or static file that contains the markdown copy, instead of serving dist output from Vite.

If the server is returning the placeholder HTML, adding sitemap/robots/prerender does nothing.

Your project is not set up for React Router v7 “Framework Mode” prerender
Your app is not using React Router v7 framework setup right now (it was using wouter in the code I saw earlier). React Router prerender requires a very specific project structure and build pipeline (react-router.config.ts, framework mode build, output folders). If the agent “added a config file” but the build is still plain Vite + wouter, there is no prerendering happening.

Even if prerender worked, the deployment has to serve the prerendered HTML
Your plan explicitly says: “Ensure the deployed server serves the pre-rendered HTML files.” That is the step most people miss on Replit. If the server still serves the placeholder route handler, it will ignore the prerender output.

Your acceptance test was never actually run
The acceptance test is: curl https://<domain>/shop should return product grid HTML. It clearly does not. That means the deployment pipeline is still wrong, regardless of what code changes were made.

What you should tell Replit instead (this is the real root fix)

You need to tell the agent to do this in order:

Phase 0: Stop serving placeholder content

Search the server for the literal text “Systemic Biological Architecture” (or your markdown heading).

Delete that response path or guard it behind a dev-only flag.

Ensure /, /shop, and /product/* do NOT return that string.

Phase 1: Serve the Vite build correctly

client/index.html must be a real React entry shell (root div + script).

The server must serve:

static assets from the Vite build output directory

SPA fallback to the built index.html for routes like /shop

Phase 2 (optional): Make it “auditable without JS”

Only after Phase 1 works:

Implement SSR or prerender.

Or accept that external tools will see a React shell and do UI review based on code.

The simplest diagnosis in one sentence

Your “auditability” plan didn’t work because you’re still stuck at the earlier step: the site is not serving the app, it’s serving a placeholder HTML page.

The fastest way to prove where it’s failing

Have Replit do this and send you the output:

curl -s https://react-vite-starter.replit.app/shop | head -n 40

If the output contains markdown headings and ingredient bullets, the server is still returning placeholder HTML.

What to ask Replit to do, exactly (copy paste)

If you want one tight instruction set:

Remove any server route that returns the markdown placeholder HTML for / or /shop.

Ensure client/index.html is a proper Vite React shell with div#root and module script to /src/main.

Ensure the server serves Vite build output (assets + SPA fallback).

Verify by checking View Source on /shop includes /assets/*.js bundle references.

Once that’s true, I can actually see the real UI and then your original “auditability” work becomes relevant.
