You are working on the Age Revive React (Vite) app. Update ONLY the “Key Benefits / What it does” section shown in the screenshot for CELLUBIOME. Goal: make it feel like a $100M longevity brand (clinical luxury), add hierarchy and section separation, remove generic “supplement” feel. Do NOT change any other sections, layout, routes, product pricing/CTA logic, or global typography. No refactors outside this section.

CONSTRAINTS
- Keep the same content scope: 2 benefit cards for CELLUBIOME.
- Do NOT add new sections above/below, do NOT change nav, do NOT change sticky CTA behavior beyond visual polish (no functional changes).
- Keep mobile-first and ensure it looks elite on iPhone width.
- No “AI fluff” copy. Short, precise, outcome-oriented. No medical claims like “treat, cure, prevent”.
- Reuse existing design tokens/colors if present. If not, use these:
  - background deep: #0A1626
  - panel: rgba(255,255,255,0.04)
  - border: rgba(244,241,234,0.14)
  - text primary: #F4F1EA
  - text muted: rgba(244,241,234,0.70)
  - accent teal: #22D3C5

SECTION COPY (replace existing headlines + card body copy exactly)
Top eyebrow label: “BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION”
Main headline: “Signal Stability Layer”
Subhead: “Restores mitochondrial recycling and gut barrier resilience to stabilize internal signaling.”

Card 01 title: “Mitochondrial Renewal”
Card 01 body:
“Delivers 500 mg Urolithin A to support mitophagy and recycling of dysfunctional mitochondria.
Supports cellular energy efficiency and resilience.”

Card 02 title: “Gut Barrier Integrity”
Card 02 body:
“Tributyrin supplies bioavailable butyrate to support intestinal barrier structure and microbial balance.
Supports the gut–mitochondria communication axis.”

DESIGN / UI CHANGES (do all)
1) Section separation:
- Give this entire section a distinct deeper navy background (#0A1626) with subtle top gradient fade (from transparent to deep navy) so it no longer blends with adjacent sections.

2) Header styling:
- Eyebrow “BIOLOGICAL FUNCTION” small, tracked, teal accent, centered.
- Headline “Signal Stability Layer” large, premium spacing, centered.
- Subhead muted, max width 520px, centered.

3) Card redesign (still stacked on mobile):
- Keep cards as two stacked modules on mobile.
- Each card: slightly brighter glass panel (rgba(255,255,255,0.04)), 1px border (rgba(244,241,234,0.14)), radius 20-24px, padding 20-24px.
- Add a large “01” / “02” ghost number (absolute) behind content at top-left, opacity 0.08–0.12, very large font-size. This is the premium “architectural” cue.
- Icon should become secondary (small). Title is primary.
- Add a thin vertical connector line between the two cards’ number areas (subtle, teal at low opacity). Keep it very understated.

4) Typography:
- Card titles: higher contrast and weight than body.
- Body: muted off-white at ~70% opacity, line-height comfortable.
- Ensure the section title hierarchy is obvious.

5) Sticky CTA overlap polish (visual only):
- If the sticky bottom bar overlaps this section visually, add a subtle backdrop blur and/or slightly darker background to the sticky bar so it doesn’t look like it’s sitting on top of content cheaply. Do NOT change behavior, only styling.

IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS
- Find the component/file that renders this “Key Benefits / What it does” block for CELLUBIOME.
- Update the JSX and Tailwind classes to match above.
- If Tailwind is not available in that file, use existing CSS module or add minimal scoped CSS just for this section.
- Do NOT edit unrelated components.
- After changes, run the app and fix any build errors you introduced.

DELIVERABLE
- Provide the full updated component code (entire file) for the section you edited.
- Also list exactly which file(s) you changed.
