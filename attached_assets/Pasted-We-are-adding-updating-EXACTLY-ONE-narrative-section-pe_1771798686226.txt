We are adding/updating EXACTLY ONE narrative section per SKU on the Shop page.
Do NOT create additional sections. Do NOT change other sections.
Only replace the existing “Why X matters / What it supports” block for each SKU with the single section below.

GLOBAL RULES (apply to all 3 sections)
- One section only per SKU.
- Left-aligned.
- Headline max 3 lines on mobile.
- Body max 4 short lines (no paragraphs).
- No bullets. No pills. No cards.
- Add one thin divider line at the end of the section.
- Give each section a subtle background “plane” so they don’t blend:
  - Cellunad: deepest navy
  - Cellubiome: slightly darker with faint teal wash
  - Cellunova: slightly darker with faint violet wash
- Keep typography consistent with the rest of the page (no new fonts).

=========================
SKU 1: CELLUNAD+ — Foundation Layer
Replace the existing narrative block with:

Label: FOUNDATION LAYER
Headline: Your energy system has a supply chain.
Body (4 lines max):
Energy rarely collapses overnight. It erodes.
When NAD+ pools decline, repair slows.
When repair slows, output drifts.
CELLUNAD+ keeps the baseline intact.

=========================
SKU 2: CELLUBIOME — Signal Stability
Replace the existing narrative block with:

Label: SIGNAL STABILITY
Headline: Your gut is an energy organ.
Body (4 lines max):
When gut signaling is unstable, energy feels noisy.
Not exhausted.
Unstable.
CELLUBIOME restores signal precision.

=========================
SKU 3: CELLUNOVA — Controlled Reset
Replace the existing narrative block with:

Label: CONTROLLED RESET
Headline: Progress requires renewal.
Body (4 lines max):
Daily inputs build.
Cycles recalibrate.
CELLUNOVA introduces structured renewal
without extremes.

=========================
DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
- Label: small uppercase, readable (not ghost), slight tracking.
- Headline: strong contrast (near-white).
- Body: readable (text-white/70+), line-height comfortable.
- Divider: border-white/10, aligned to content width.
- Add section padding top/bottom so it reads as a chapter (mobile: ~56–72px total vertical padding).

ACCEPTANCE TEST (375px width)
- No wrapping beyond rules.
- Each SKU shows only its one section.
- Sections are visually distinct due to subtle background plane shifts.
- No extra UI patterns introduced.
