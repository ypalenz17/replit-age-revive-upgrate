ROLE: Elite conversion copywriter + senior UX engineer. Update the Shop page to tell a persuasive, minimal-luxury narrative for ALL three products: CELLUNAD+, CELLUBIOME, CELLUNOVA. The page must guide an average person to understand what the product is for and feel compelled to buy by end of scroll. Keep it compliant: no disease claims, no “treat/diagnose/cure/prevent/reverse,” no guaranteed outcomes.

GLOBAL RULES
- Keep sections tight: 1 headline + max 2 lines body whenever possible.
- No pill/tag UI. No rounded-full for major elements.
- High contrast. No faint ghost text that becomes unreadable on mobile.
- Avoid jargon without a plain-English line. If technical words appear, include a simple translation nearby.
- The narrative must flow: WHY → WHAT → TELEMETRY → STANDARDS → SPEC → ARC → CLOSE.
- Do not increase page length dramatically; reuse existing section components.

PHASE 1 — CONTENT + NARRATIVE (IMPLEMENT FIRST)
1) Implement a product copy map keyed by slug/selected module:
- cellunad
- cellubiome
- cellunova

2) Replace the copy in the existing sections with the VERBATIM text below for each product.
3) Ensure headings, labels, and CTAs match exactly.

CELLUNAD+ COPY (slug: cellunad)
A) Product identity block:
Overline: DAILY INPUT LAYER
Title: CELLUNAD+
Subtitle: Daily NAD+ support engineered for consistency, not hype.
Micro line: Protocol: 2 capsules daily • System target: Cellular energy + repair pathways

B) Why this exists:
Label: WHY DAILY INPUT MATTERS
Headline: Energy doesn’t crash. It quietly loses efficiency.
Body: Most people don’t notice the drift until output drops. CELLUNAD+ is built as a steady daily input, supporting the pathways that keep energy production and cellular maintenance running clean.

C) What it supports:
Label: WHAT IT SUPPORTS
Headline: A cleaner baseline you can build on.
Lines (no bullets):
- Supports cellular energy production and resilience
- Supports NAD+ metabolism and daily replenishment
- Supports healthy redox balance and mitochondrial function
- Supports methylation cofactors for normal cellular processes

D) Telemetry:
Label: TELEMETRY
Headline: Biological response, quantified.
Body: If you can’t measure change, you’re guessing. Age Revive pairs protocol inputs with measurable feedback, so decisions get smarter over time.
Rows:
01 NAD+ Pathway Activity — substrate + cofactor alignment
02 Redox Balance — steady-state output support
03 Methylation Support — cofactor sufficiency cues

E) Standards label (shared below)

F) Compound specification intro:
Label: COMPOUND SPECIFICATION
Meta line: ACTIVES: 8 • SERVING: 2 capsules daily
Reassurance line: All dosages reflect clinically studied ranges and bioavailable forms.
Declaration line: No proprietary formulations.

G) Protocol arc:
Label: PROTOCOL ARC
Headline: What you may notice over time.
Subline: Response varies. Consistency compounds.
Phase I — Calibration (Days 1–3): Routine locks in. Inputs become consistent.
Phase II — Stabilization (Week 1–2): Steady daily support. Less “spike,” more baseline.
Phase III — Integration (Week 3–4): Compounding effect. This becomes your default.

H) Close:
Headline: Build a baseline that doesn’t rely on motivation.
Body: If you’re serious about longevity, consistency is the advantage.
Primary CTA: Add to Stack
Secondary link: View Evidence →

CELLUBIOME COPY (slug: cellubiome)
A) Product identity block:
Overline: SIGNALING LAYER
Title: CELLUBIOME
Subtitle: Daily gut-mito support designed to reinforce your foundation.
Micro line: Protocol: 2 enteric-coated capsules daily • System target: Gut–mito signaling + resilience

B) Why this exists:
Label: WHY SIGNALING MATTERS
Headline: Your gut is not separate from your energy.
Body: When gut signaling is off, output feels noisy: energy, recovery, and consistency drift. CELLUBIOME supports the gut–mito connection with a focused, daily input.

C) What it supports:
Label: WHAT IT SUPPORTS
Headline: A steadier system signal.
Lines (no bullets):
- Supports gut barrier integrity and digestive resilience
- Supports mitochondrial renewal signals (cellular efficiency support)
- Supports short-chain fatty acid activity for gut environment support
- Supports consistency across sleep, training, and daily output

D) Telemetry:
Label: TELEMETRY
Headline: Biological response, quantified.
Body: Signals show up before “feelings.” Age Revive uses measurable feedback to reduce guesswork and keep the protocol honest.
Rows:
01 Gut Resilience Signals — consistency + tolerance cues
02 Mitochondrial Efficiency — recovery + output stability cues
03 Inflammation Balance — resilience trend cues

F) Compound specification intro:
Label: COMPOUND SPECIFICATION
Meta line: ACTIVES: 2 • SERVING: 2 enteric-coated capsules daily
Reassurance line: Full dosing disclosed. Focused inputs, no filler complexity.
Declaration line: No proprietary formulations.

G) Protocol arc:
Label: PROTOCOL ARC
Headline: What you may notice over time.
Subline: The signal stabilizes before it feels dramatic.
Phase I — Calibration (Days 1–3): Routine locks in. The system gets consistent input.
Phase II — Stabilization (Week 1–2): Digestion and tolerance cues become clearer.
Phase III — Integration (Week 3–4): More reliable output, less “noise.”

H) Close:
Headline: Fix the signal. Then everything performs better.
Body: Build the foundation you can actually stack on.

CELLUNOVA COPY (slug: cellunova)
A) Product identity block:
Overline: CYCLE LAYER
Title: CELLUNOVA
Subtitle: A 7-day monthly reset protocol designed for discipline, not extremes.
Micro line: Protocol: 5 capsules daily for 7 days • System target: Renewal cadence + cleanup pathways

B) Why this exists:
Label: WHY A CYCLE EXISTS
Headline: Daily inputs build. Cycles recalibrate.
Body: Most people either do nothing or do too much. CELLUNOVA is a controlled cadence: a short, repeatable cycle designed to support renewal pathways without turning your life into a protocol.

C) What it supports:
Label: WHAT IT SUPPORTS
Headline: A reset you can actually repeat.
Lines (no bullets):
- Supports cellular cleanup and renewal pathways
- Supports antioxidant defense and oxidative balance
- Supports healthy inflammatory response balance
- Supports resilience during periods of higher stress or load

D) Telemetry:
Label: TELEMETRY
Headline: Cycles are where signal becomes obvious.
Body: A short protocol window makes changes easier to observe and compare over time. Age Revive uses feedback to keep cycles consistent and measurable.
Rows:
01 Recovery Signal — sleep + training tolerance cues
02 Inflammation Balance — resilience trend cues
03 Output Stability — consistency across the week

F) Compound specification intro:
Label: COMPOUND SPECIFICATION
Meta line: ACTIVES: 10 • PROTOCOL: 7 days (5 capsules daily)
Reassurance line: Full dosing disclosed. Built as a cycle, not a daily stimulant.
Declaration line: No proprietary formulations.
Micro note: Contains wheat (spermidine source).

G) Protocol arc:
Label: PROTOCOL ARC
Headline: What the 7-day cycle feels like.
Subline: Keep the cadence. Don’t chase intensity.
Days 1–2 — Initiation: You may feel “different” or feel nothing. Both are normal.
Days 3–5 — Engagement: The cycle becomes steadier. Focus on routine.
Days 6–7 — Completion: Finish clean. Consistency matters more than sensation.
Post-cycle — Return to baseline: Resume your daily stack. Repeat monthly if it fits your system.

H) Close:
Headline: The reset is the advantage.
Body: A short, repeatable cadence beats sporadic extremes.

SHARED STANDARDS (use for ALL products)
Label: FORMULATION STANDARDS
01 Third-Party Tested — Independent lab verification
02 Standardized Actives — Precise concentration control
03 Delivery Matters — Form + release designed per protocol
04 Quality Control — Multi-stage review process

PHASE 2 — DESIGN CONSISTENCY (MATCH HOME SYSTEM)
- Use Home’s engineered corner system (no rounded-full for major UI).
- Ensure all labels and links meet contrast requirements (use the lighter accent blue already used on Shop).
- Keep interactive “References →” links clearly visible and subordinate (smaller than body copy).
- Ensure section spacing doesn’t create dead zones; target 48–64px between major sections on mobile.

PHASE 3 — POLISH + MOBILE CHECK
- Check 375px and 390px: no clipping, no truncation, no low-contrast ghost text.
- Ensure each product’s narrative fits without adding new sections.
- Confirm the product selector rail updates the copy map correctly when switching modules.

DELIVERABLE
- Implement the copy map and replace text across the Shop page accordingly.
- List the files edited.
- Confirm it renders correctly for: /shop/cellunad, /shop/cellubiome, /shop/cellunova (or your existing routing).
