STOP redesigning. This is a targeted mobile layout fix only.

Scope: Home page hero section ONLY.
Do not change copy. Do not change colors. Do not change overall layout structure.
Only update Tailwind classes / CSS to make the hero section readable and properly responsive on mobile.

Problem (from screenshot):
- Trust strip text is too faint and looks like a background artifact.
- CTA row is cramped on mobile.
- Vertical spacing is off; elements feel crowded and misaligned.
- We need a clean, expensive-looking mobile layout.

Rules:
- No refactors.
- No new sections.
- Only edit the hero component styles.
- Use responsive classes to fix mobile < 420px.
- After changes, provide the exact file paths edited.

Required Mobile Behavior (Acceptance Tests):
1) On iPhone width (375px):
   - Headline fits without awkward line breaks.
   - Subcopy wraps cleanly (no orphan single words).
   - Trust strip is readable (at least text-white/60) and wraps into 2 lines max.
   - CTAs stack vertically: primary full-width, secondary full-width, 12px gap.
   - Microcopy under CTAs is readable (text-white/60 or stronger).
2) Nothing overlaps. No absolute positioning that causes collision.
3) The trust strip MUST NOT sit on top of the grid as faint ghost text.

Implementation Instructions:
A) Hero container
- Ensure a normal document flow layout: flex-col + gap, NO fixed heights, NO absolute positioning for hero content.
- Add padding tuned for mobile: px-5 or px-6, pt-16 (accounting for header), pb-10.

B) Headline
- Use clamp for font sizing and tighter leading on mobile:
  text-[clamp(40px,10vw,56px)] leading-[0.95]
- Reduce aggressive italics/opacity tricks that harm readability.
- Secondary line (Gut Resilience) should remain visually distinct via opacity, not unreadable color.

C) Trust strip
- Make it a flex-wrap row so it doesn’t look like a single faint line:
  flex flex-wrap gap-x-6 gap-y-2
- Increase legibility:
  text-white/70 (minimum) and text-[11px] tracking-[0.22em]
- If you’re using separators, ensure they don’t break alignment on wrap.
- Keep it to 2 lines max on 375px.

D) CTA row
- Stack on mobile:
  flex flex-col sm:flex-row
  w-full
  gap-3
- Buttons should be full-width on mobile:
  w-full sm:w-auto
- Ensure button labels remain centered and readable.

E) Microcopy under CTAs
- Increase opacity:
  text-white/60
- Use text-sm and normal tracking; do not use ultra-wide tracking here.

Deliverable:
- Commit the class changes.
- List edited files and the specific hero section blocks updated.
