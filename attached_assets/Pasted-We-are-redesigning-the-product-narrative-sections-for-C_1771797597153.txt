We are redesigning the product narrative sections for CELLUNAD+, CELLUBIOME, and CELLUNOVA.

DO NOT change the overall layout system.
DO NOT change fonts.
DO NOT change brand colors.
Only refine structure, spacing, and content.

GOALS:
- Reduce text density
- Improve visual separation between sections
- Create architectural differentiation between the three products
- Maintain compliance (structure/function language only)
- Make the page feel premium, strategic, and controlled

========================
CONTENT REPLACEMENTS
========================

CELLUNAD+

Replace narrative section with:

Label:
FOUNDATION LAYER

Headline:
Your Energy System Has a Supply Chain.

Subhead:
CELLUNAD+ restores daily NAD+ input so your cells don’t run on deficit.

Replace feature bullets with 3 structured blocks:

DAILY NAD+ INPUT
Maintains NAD+ availability for repair and energy metabolism.

REDOX BALANCE
Stabilizes mitochondrial electron flow for steady output.

METHYLATION ALIGNMENT
Provides active B-vitamin cofactors to keep pathways synchronized.

Replace “Why Daily Input Matters” section with:

Energy rarely disappears overnight.
It erodes.

When NAD+ pools decline, repair slows.
When repair slows, output drifts.
When output drifts, everything feels harder.

CELLUNAD+ keeps the baseline intact.


========================

CELLUBIOME

Label:
SIGNAL STABILITY

Headline:
Your Gut Is an Energy Organ.

Subhead:
CELLUBIOME reinforces the gut–mitochondria axis so output stays clean.

Feature structure:

BARRIER INTEGRITY
Supports epithelial resilience and postbiotic signaling.

MITOCHONDRIAL RECOVERY
Urolithin A promotes mitophagy and cellular renewal.

SIGNAL CLARITY
Tributyrin supports short-chain fatty acid pathways that influence energy balance.

Replace “Why Signaling Matters” with:

When gut signaling is unstable,
energy feels noisy.

Not exhausted.
Unstable.

CELLUBIOME restores signal precision.


========================

CELLUNOVA

Label:
CONTROLLED RESET

Headline:
Progress Requires Renewal.

Subhead:
CELLUNOVA is a 7-day autophagy-aligned cycle designed to clear accumulated stress without extremes.

Feature structure:

CELLULAR CLEANUP
Supports pathways associated with autophagy signaling.

OXIDATIVE DEFENSE
Polyphenols support redox balance during higher demand periods.

SENESCENCE MODULATION
Fisetin included within a structured, repeatable cadence.

Replace “Why a Cycle Exists” with:

Daily inputs build.
Cycles recalibrate.

CELLUNOVA introduces structured renewal
without impulsive restriction.


========================
DESIGN REFINEMENTS
========================

1. Reduce top padding of each section by 20–25%.
2. Increase space between headline and first feature block.
3. Increase space before CTA area.
4. Remove redundant dividers where not needed.
5. Introduce subtle background variation per product:
   - CELLUNAD+: deeper navy gradient with subtle cool glow
   - CELLUBIOME: navy with faint teal radial depth
   - CELLUNOVA: navy with faint violet undertone
6. Keep text lines under 2–3 lines maximum to avoid wrapping.
7. Ensure no section visually blends into the next.

Return:
- Files modified
- Spacing changes summary
- Confirmation no layout structure was broken
