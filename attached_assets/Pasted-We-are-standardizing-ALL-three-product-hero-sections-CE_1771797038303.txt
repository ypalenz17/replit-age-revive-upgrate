We are standardizing ALL three product hero sections (CELLUNAD+, CELLUBIOME, CELLUNOVA) to one elite template. Fix them as a system, not individually.

NON-NEGOTIABLES
- One consistent primary CTA style across all products (same color, same height, same radius).
- No per-product CTA colors (remove teal CTA and purple CTA).
- Remove duplicated product naming (product name should appear once per hero).
- Micro protocol/target line must be readable (not ghost).
- Benefit list must be compact (3 lines max, no repeated “Supports”).
- Specs row must never wrap awkwardly.
- Keep minimal luxury, no gimmicks.

APPLY THIS TEMPLATE TO ALL THREE PRODUCTS:

A) Top identity block (keep)
Overline (readable): DAILY INPUT LAYER / SIGNALING LAYER / CYCLE LAYER (per product)
Product name: large once only
Subtitle: keep current but ensure max 2 lines and readable

Micro line (make readable):
- Cellunad: “Protocol: 2 caps daily • Target: energy + repair”
- Cellubiome: “Protocol: 2 enteric caps daily • Target: gut–mito signaling”
- Cellunova: “Protocol: 7 days • 5 caps/day • Target: renewal cadence”
Increase opacity to ~text-white/60–70 and reduce tracking.

B) Bottle stage (keep centered)
- Keep bottle size consistent across products.
- Add subtle hero vignette behind bottle so this section is a distinct chapter.

C) Lower pricing block (fix duplication)
- Keep only the price on the right.
- Remove the repeated product name below (e.g., remove the second “CELLUBIOME / CELLUNOVA” line).
- Keep only a small label (e.g., DAILY PROTOCOL / 7-DAY CYCLE) if needed.

D) Short descriptor line under label (tighten)
- Cellunad: “NR + cofactors. 8 actives. Clinically aligned.”
- Cellubiome: “Urolithin A + tributyrin. 2-compound precision.”
- Cellunova: “Polyphenol + senolytic stack. 10 actives. 7-day cycle.”
Ensure it fits in 1–2 lines max.

E) Benefit list (replace the 4 repeated “Supports…” lines)
Use 3 compact lines max per product (no bullets, no repeated “Supports”):

CELLUNAD+:
- Cellular energy + resilience
- NAD+ metabolism + replenishment
- Redox + methylation support

CELLUBIOME:
- Gut barrier integrity + digestive resilience
- Mito efficiency + recovery support
- Output consistency (sleep, training, daily)

CELLUNOVA:
- Cellular cleanup + renewal pathways
- Oxidative balance + antioxidant defense
- Resilience during higher load

F) Specs row (must be one line, no wrapping)
Replace the current broken spec row with a single structured line that never wraps:
- Cellunad: “Glass bottle • UV-protected • 2 caps daily”
- Cellubiome: “Glass bottle • UV-protected • 2 enteric caps daily”
- Cellunova: “Glass bottle • UV-protected • 5 caps/day × 7 days”
If needed, reduce font size slightly and tighten tracking so it stays on one line.

G) Wheat note (Cellunova only)
Current styling is wrong. Replace with a calm, structured compliance note aligned to the content column:
“Contains wheat (spermidine source).”
No yellow highlight. No warning icon. Use text-white/60 and small label style.

H) Primary CTA (one system style)
Primary button text: “ADD TO STACK →”
- Same button style for all products (no teal/purple variants)
- Height 44–48px on mobile
- Rounded-lg
- Subtle inner highlight, no heavy gradient
Secondary links below: “INGREDIENTS” and “EVIDENCE” as inline links (consistent styling)

I) Bottom module selector rail spacing
Ensure CTA area has breathing room above the fixed module rail, and the rail never overlaps content.

ACCEPTANCE TESTS (375px width)
- Product name appears once per hero.
- CTA looks identical across all products.
- Micro protocol line is readable.
- Benefit list is compact and scannable.
- Spec row never breaks awkwardly.
- Cellunova wheat note is calm, aligned, and not highlighted.
- Heroes feel like the same system, not three themes.

DELIVERABLE
- Implement changes in the product hero template component used by all three.
- List files edited.
- Confirm tested on all three modules by switching selector.
