Redesign the entire hero section (header through CTAs) to feel like a $150k engineered-luxury biotech brand. Keep the current palette and vibe, but tighten hierarchy, geometry, and materials. No new sections, just redesign within existing hero.

GOALS
- Hero content must feel staged on its own optical plane, not pasted on the grid.
- Reduce “template” cues: big pills, big frosted rectangles, overly tall buttons.
- Improve scan order: label -> headline -> subhead -> proof -> CTA.
- Mobile-first, 375px and 390px must look perfect.

TASKS

1) Header geometry
- Remove rounded-full on the SHOP button and other major UI.
- Use a consistent radius system (rounded-lg).
- Reduce SHOP button padding so it feels like a control surface, not a bubble.
- Keep cart badge but ensure it’s aligned and not floating.

2) Add hero scrim and lighting plane
- Add a subtle hero-only background scrim behind the text cluster:
  - radial gradient darkening behind the headline/subhead area
  - optional faint noise overlay
- Reduce grid interference behind hero content without changing the whole page:
  - use a mask or overlay so grid is less visible under text.

3) Label row refinement
- Keep “PROTOCOL-GRADE SUPPLEMENTS” but reduce tracking slightly.
- Make the side lines thinner and lower contrast, or shorten them.
- Ensure perfect alignment.

4) Headline refinement
- Keep the 2-line headline but remove forced italic on line 2.
- Use opacity and weight for hierarchy instead:
  - Line 1: text-white
  - Line 2: text-white/70–80
- Tighten line-height and reduce excessive vertical space.

5) Subhead
- Constrain width (max-w) so line breaks are controlled and premium.
- Slightly increase legibility (text-white/70–80).
- Make key terms (NAD+, gut-mito, 7-day) subtly emphasized via opacity or underline, not color spam.

6) Proof bar redesign (replace the current bullet box)
- Replace the frosted bullet rectangle with a compact “Proof Bar”:
  - either a single row with dividers or a 2-column micro-grid
  - tiny square dots or micro icons, not large bullets
  - tighter padding, smaller height
  - higher legibility (text-white/75)
- If COA library is not live, change the label to “COA library coming soon”.
- If it is live, make it clickable.

7) CTAs
- Reduce button height (target 44–48px).
- Use rounded-lg, not rounded-full.
- Primary: teal system button with subtle inner highlight.
- Secondary: dimmer glass outline, clearly secondary.
- Reduce vertical gaps so CTA block is not dominating.

8) Microcopy
- Increase opacity to readable (text-white/60).
- Bring it closer to CTAs.
- Keep it one tight line.

ACCEPTANCE TESTS
- Hero feels like a staged product interface, not a landing page template.
- Grid does not compete with text.
- Proof bar looks intentional and compact.
- Buttons feel engineered, not puffy.
- Typography hierarchy is obvious within 1 second.

DELIVERABLE
- Implement and list edited files.
- Confirm tested at 375px and 390px widths.
