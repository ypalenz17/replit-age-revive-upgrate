Targeted mobile layout fix. Stop redesigning. No copy changes. No new sections.

Problems (from screenshots):
1) Excessive empty vertical space between blocks. Feels like giant padding/min-heights/gaps.
2) The 4 key proof chips (01–04: 3RD PARTY TESTING, etc.) are misaligned and some text/numbers are drifting outside their “boxes”.
3) Overall: spacing rhythm is inconsistent and looks unprofessional on mobile.

Scope:
- Home page only.
- Only adjust Tailwind classes/CSS for spacing, wrapping, and chip layout.
- Do NOT change brand colors, fonts, or component structure. No refactors beyond class edits.

ACCEPTANCE TESTS (must pass on 375px and 390px widths)
A) Vertical rhythm:
- No section should have giant dead space above/below unless intentionally a hero break.
- Between major sections: ~48–64px (not 100px+).
- Within sections: consistent gap scale (gap-4 / gap-6), not random.
B) Proof chips (01–04):
- All chips must be fully inside their container.
- Numbers must align consistently (left side inside the chip).
- Text must not overflow or clip.
- Chips must lay out as a clean 2x2 grid on mobile.
C) No overflow:
- No element should extend past the card/container bounds.
- No horizontal scrolling.

IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

1) Kill the dead space (most likely causes)
Search for any of these in the Home page sections and reduce them:
- py-20 / py-24 / py-28  -> replace with py-12 or py-14 on mobile
- mt-20 / mb-20 / space-y-16 -> reduce to mt-10/mb-10/space-y-10
- min-h-[...] used for sections -> remove for mobile (keep only for desktop if needed)
- gap-12 / gap-16 inside mobile stacks -> reduce to gap-6

Do it with responsive overrides:
- Example: `py-16 sm:py-24` (mobile tighter, desktop can breathe)

2) Fix the key proof chips layout (01–04)
Wherever the 4 chips are rendered:
- Replace current layout with a strict grid on mobile:
  wrapper: `grid grid-cols-2 gap-3 w-full`
- Each chip must be a self-contained flex row:
  chip: `flex items-center gap-2 rounded-lg border border-white/12 bg-white/5 px-3 py-2`
- Number badge must be inside the chip and never absolute:
  number: `text-teal-300/90 text-[12px] font-medium tabular-nums`
- Label text must truncate safely instead of overflowing:
  label: `text-white/70 text-[12px] tracking-[0.12em] uppercase leading-none truncate`
- Ensure parent container is NOT using overflow-visible if it causes drift.
- Remove any absolute positioning, negative margins, or translate hacks from the chips.

3) Fix the protocol card spacing
In the protocol selector cards, reduce wasted vertical space:
- Remove or reduce any `min-h-*` or large `py-*` on the image container.
- Add a tight, consistent internal spacing scale:
  card content stack: `flex flex-col gap-4`
- Ensure buttons and chips sit directly under content, not floating with huge margins.

4) Verify no “random pushes”
Search for:
- `translate-y-*`, `-mt-*`, `top-*` used for layout (not effects)
If any of those are used to position chips or key info, remove them and use normal flow.

DELIVERABLE
- Implement changes.
- Tell me exactly which file(s) you edited.
- Confirm tested at 375px and 390px and that the 01–04 chips are a clean 2x2 grid with no overflow.
