ou are refining an existing React (Vite + Tailwind) component.

Do NOT refactor structure.
Do NOT remove the sticky price bar.
Do NOT remove the icons.
Do NOT remove the ghost background numbers (01 / 02).
Do NOT change layout hierarchy.

You are only refining typography, spacing, color tone, and copy.

This is an ultra-premium modern longevity brand.
No glow. No neon. No SaaS dashboard look.

Update the section positioning

Keep the section label “Biological Function” but make it quieter:

Smaller

Increased letter spacing

Lower contrast

Change the main header hierarchy so:

“SIGNAL STABILITY” is dominant

“Layer” is smaller and lighter beneath it

They should not feel equal weight.

Replace the subline with:

Supports mitochondrial renewal and gut barrier resilience to preserve internal signaling balance.

Keep it to one sentence.

Increase vertical spacing between the subline and the first card. Premium brands breathe.

Refine card copy

Card 1 body:

500 mg Urolithin A supports mitophagy and the renewal of aging mitochondria.
Sustains cellular energy efficiency over time.

Card 2 body:

Enteric Tributyrin delivers bioavailable butyrate to reinforce intestinal barrier integrity.
Supports microbial balance and long-term signaling stability.

Keep sentences short. No extra filler language.

Upgrade the visual tone of the section

Make the section background slightly deeper navy than the previous section.

Add subtle separation at the top so this feels like entering a new layer.

Reduce border opacity on cards.

Remove any heavy shadow.

Add very subtle internal vertical gradient to the cards so they feel layered, not flat.

Reduce teal saturation slightly so it feels mineral, not neon.

This should feel calm and architectural.

Improve card hierarchy

Keep:

Ghost 01 / 02 background numbers

Icons

Remove redundancy if there is a small visible “01” next to the icon.
The ghost number is enough.

Increase internal padding inside the cards.
Slightly tighten body line-height.

Cards should feel like biological layers floating in depth, not clickable ecommerce tiles.

Refine sticky price bar

Keep structure intact.

When overlapping dark sections:

Darken the background slightly

Add subtle blur

Add a soft top border

It should feel like a floating control panel, not a Shopify footer.

Reduce button saturation slightly.
Keep CTA text unchanged.

Goal:

This section must feel like ultra-premium modern longevity.

Calm.
Confident.
Timeless.
Biological.
Architectural.

It should feel like stepping into a longevity system chamber — not scrolling a supplement page.

Do not add animations.
Do not redesign layout.
Only refine
