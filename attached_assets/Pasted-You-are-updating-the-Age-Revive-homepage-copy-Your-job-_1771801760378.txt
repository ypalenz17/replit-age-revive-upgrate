You are updating the Age Revive homepage copy.
Your job is to replace text only. The design must not change.

HARD CONSTRAINTS:

ZERO design changes. Do not alter layout, spacing, CSS, Tailwind classes, typography, colors, components, DOM structure, animations, images, buttons, links, or section order.

Do not add or remove any elements.

Change only existing text strings in-place.

Keep the new copy equal or shorter than current wherever possible. If any line wraps or overflows, use the shorter fallback alternatives provided.

Do not change product names (CELLUBIOME, CELLUNAD+, CELLUNOVA).

Do not change navigation or footer links unless explicitly listed below.

Output should be identical visually except for the words.

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:

Locate the homepage file(s) and any constants/data objects that store homepage copy.

Replace the exact strings according to the “TEXT REPLACEMENTS” list below.

Verify the diff shows only text edits.

TEXT REPLACEMENTS:

HERO

Replace body paragraph with:
"One system. Three protocols. NAD+ support, gut-mito support, and a 7-day monthly pulse."

Replace the four value lines with:
"ABSORPTION FIRST"
"VERIFIED POTENCY"
"CLINICAL-LEVEL DOSING"
"UV-PROTECTED GLASS"

Replace the micro line under buttons with:
"Start now. Consistency compounds."
If wrapping occurs, use:
"Start now. Build momentum."

SYSTEM HEADER

Replace "CHOOSE YOUR STARTING POINT" with:
"START WHERE YOU FEEL IT"
If wrapping occurs, use:
"START HERE"

CELLUBIOME CARD

Replace category line with:
"GUT + MITO SIGNALING"

Replace description with:
"Daily gut-mito support for steady energy."

Replace bullets with:
"Steady energy"
"Gut barrier"
"Mito renewal"

CELLUNAD+ CARD

Replace description with:
"Protocol-grade NAD+ support with key cofactors."

Replace bullets with:
"NAD+ support"
"DNA maintenance"
"Cell energy"

CELLUNOVA CARD

Replace category line with:
"7-DAY AUTOPHAGY PULSE"

Replace description with:
"Monthly 7-day pulse to support cellular renewal."

Replace bullets with:
"Cell renewal"
"Autophagy support"
"Resilience"

QUALITY LIST

Replace "Precise concentration, no variability" with:
"Consistent potency, every batch"

Replace "Targeted absorption" with:
"Absorbs where it matters"

Replace "Multi-stage review process" with:
"Batch-by-batch review"

GUT-MITO AXIS CARD

Replace paragraph with:
"Support gut-mito communication for steady energy and digestive resilience."

Replace tags with:
"ENTERIC DELIVERY"
"BARRIER SUPPORT"
"MITO RENEWAL"

NAD+ INFRASTRUCTURE CARD

Replace paragraph with:
"Daily NAD+ support with cofactors for consistent cellular energy."

Replace tags with:
"NAD+ SUPPORT"
"OXIDATIVE BALANCE"
"METHYLATION SUPPORT"

AUTOPHAGY PULSE CARD

Replace paragraph with:
"A 7-day monthly pulse designed to support cellular renewal and resilience."

Replace tags with:
"SHORT CYCLE"
"CLEANUP SUPPORT"
"RETURN TO BASE"

FRAMEWORK SUBTEXT

Replace "A framework for mapping protocols to systems. Not medical advice." with:
"A map from science to your routine. Not medical advice."

6 PILLARS LIST

GENOMIC STABILITY paragraph:
"NAD+ supports enzymes involved in DNA maintenance and cell resilience."
tag line:
"NAD+ • SIRTUINS"

TELOMERE INTEGRITY paragraph:
"Support telomere pathways that help cells divide cleanly over time."
tag line:
"NR • LONGEVITY"

EPIGENETIC SIGNALING paragraph:
"Gut-derived signals help regulate gene expression across the body."
tag line:
"METHYLATION • GUT AXIS"

NUTRIENT SENSING paragraph:
"Cells sense fuel levels and shift into maintenance when needed."
tag line:
"AMPK • MTOR"

MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION paragraph:
"Support mitochondrial renewal so energy output stays strong."
tag line:
"MITOPHAGY • ATP"

CELLULAR SENESCENCE paragraph:
"Support healthy aging by helping manage senescence-related stress signals."
tag line:
"FISETIN • SENESCENCE"

FINAL CHECK:

Confirm no CSS/class/layout changes.

Confirm only copy changed.

If any text wraps badly, swap to the shorter alternatives without changing design.
