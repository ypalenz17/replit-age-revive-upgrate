You are an elite UI designer and frontend engineer redesigning the DESKTOP hero section only.

GOAL:
Make the hero feel like a $100M premium longevity brand.
Cinematic, restrained, asymmetric, object-forward.
Mobile must remain unchanged.

HARD RULES:
- Do not change any copy in this task.
- Do not change global typography, colors, design tokens, or brand palette.
- Do not add or remove sections.
- Do not refactor components or restructure the page beyond the hero layout container.
- No new libraries.
- Only adjust layout, spacing, and visual presentation of the hero on desktop (lg and up).
- Mobile and tablet layouts should stay exactly as they are today unless required for desktop-only styling.

HERO REDESIGN SPEC (DESKTOP lg+):
1) Convert hero to a 12-column grid.
   - Left content spans columns 1-6
   - Right visual spans columns 7-12
   - Left align hero text on desktop.

2) Add a product stack visual on the right using existing product renders (CELLUNAD+, CELLUBIOME, CELLUNOVA).
   - Use one composed stack image if it exists. If not, layer 2-3 images with absolute positioning.
   - Slight stagger between products for depth.
   - Add subtle shadow depth.
   - Add a very subtle teal radial glow behind the stack (opacity low, tasteful).

3) Increase headline prominence on desktop:
   - Increase font size ~20-30% at lg+.
   - Increase hero vertical padding top/bottom ~25-35% at lg+.
   - Keep line breaks consistent and premium.

4) Replace the vertical feature list block layout with a premium inline proof row under the CTAs:
   - Keep the same four items text.
   - Display in one row with thin dividers.
   - Small caps, lower opacity, tighter spacing.

5) CTA cluster refinement:
   - Keep same buttons and actions.
   - Increase primary button height slightly and refine padding on desktop.
   - Secondary becomes quieter (ghost or text-link style), but do not remove it.

6) Background depth:
   - Keep the grid.
   - Add subtle vignette or gradient sweep to create depth behind hero content on desktop only.
   - Do not add noise or extra patterns.

DELIVERABLE:
Return the updated homepage file with hero desktop redesign implemented.
Confirm that only hero desktop styles and layout were changed.
