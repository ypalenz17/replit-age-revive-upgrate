STOP redesign drift. We need an elite “system page” cleanup pass.

Context:
Shop page drifted away from elite: all sections look the same color, too much text, weak section separation, inconsistent alignment, and some copy is wrapping/clipping. Restore deeper navy tones and create clear section planes so the scroll becomes readable and inevitable.

NON-NEGOTIABLES
- Do NOT invent new colors. Use existing palette: deep navy base, off-white text, lighter accent blue/teal for indices/links/underlines only.
- Do NOT add new UI patterns (no pills, no accordion cards, no chip badges).
- Do NOT change design system components except to restore intended styling and fix bugs.
- The page must remain compliant: no disease claims, no “treat/diagnose/cure/prevent/reverse,” no guaranteed outcomes.

PHASE 1 — VISUAL SYSTEM RESET (fix the “everything blends” problem)
1) Restore deeper navy “planes” between major sections.
- Implement an alternating section background treatment (subtle only):
  Plane A: deeper navy (darker) + grid faint
  Plane B: slightly lighter navy + grid even fainter
  Plane C: deep vignette (dark) for key headings
- Apply these planes to MAJOR sections so the user can feel boundaries:
  - Product Hero (Plane A)
  - Why Daily Input Matters (Plane B)
  - What It Supports (Plane A)
  - Telemetry (Plane B)
  - Formulation Standards (Plane A)
  - Compound Specification (Plane C) (text-dense, needs most contrast)
  - Protocol Arc (Plane B)
  - Final CTA + Footer (Plane A)

2) Grid control:
- The grid must be atmospheric, not readable.
- Reduce grid opacity further in text-dense planes (Compound Spec + Telemetry + Protocol Arc).
- Do not let grid lines cut through paragraph text.

3) Typography hierarchy:
- Section label: readable (not ghost), consistent
- Section headline: strong
- Body: readable (not white/40)
- Metadata: slightly dimmer
- Ensure every section has a clear label + headline + 1–2 lines max where possible.

PHASE 2 — LAYOUT + ALIGNMENT BUG FIXES (stop overlaps, drift, and repeated UI)
4) Bottom module selector rail:
- It must NEVER cover content. Add global bottom padding equal to rail height + safe-area inset.
- If the rail is fixed, add `padding-bottom: calc(RAIL_HEIGHT + env(safe-area-inset-bottom) + 16px)` to the page wrapper.
- Optionally hide the rail when footer is in view.

5) Remove duplicate rails:
- The module selector rail is appearing mid-page multiple times. There must be ONE instance only (fixed bottom), not repeated inside sections.

6) Header icon colors:
- Hamburger icon must be same white tone as other icons. No random teal hamburger.
- Cart badge accent allowed, but subtle.

7) Alignment discipline:
- All section labels, headlines, and body text must share the same left gutter.
- Dividers must align with content width (not full bleed if text is inset).
- Fix any misaligned divider lines or drifting margins.

8) Wrapping/clipping fixes:
- Fix any missing spaces or typography errors (example: “CRASH.IT” must be “CRASH. IT”).
- Prevent awkward wraps by shortening the few long lines listed in Phase 3 below.
- Ensure metadata lines don’t wrap into 3 lines; keep to 1–2 lines max.

PHASE 3 — EXACT TEXT REPLACEMENT (3 PRODUCTS) + SHORTENING RULES
Implement a content map keyed by selected product/module. This is exact replacement. Do not “improve wording” beyond the specified short versions.

GLOBAL SHORTENING RULE:
- Any paragraph longer than 2 lines on mobile must be condensed to the provided short version.
- Avoid jargon-first. Always provide the human meaning in the same sentence.

PROTOCOL ARC:

Headline: WHAT YOU MAY NOTICE OVER TIME.
Subline: Response varies. Consistency compounds.
Phase I — Calibration (Days 1–3): Routine locks in. Inputs become consistent.
Phase II — Stabilization (Week 1–2): Steady daily support. Less “spike,” more baseline.
Phase III — Integration (Week 3–4): Compounding effect. This becomes your default.
