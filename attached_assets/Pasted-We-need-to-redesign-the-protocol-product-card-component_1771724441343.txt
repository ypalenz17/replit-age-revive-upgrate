We need to redesign the protocol product card component to look expensive and be easy to scan on mobile.

GOAL
- Make the product image (bottle/jar) larger and visually dominant.
- Place the product image OUTSIDE the info card (overlapping it) so the card becomes a clean “info console”.
- Improve hierarchy so info is aesthetic and scannable.

SCOPE
- ProtocolSelectorCard (or whatever component renders each product in “Select Your Protocol”).
- Keep existing copy and data. Do not invent claims.
- Keep the existing color palette and glow effect.

STRUCTURE CHANGE (required)
1) Make a parent wrapper: `relative`
2) Create the info card as a separate element:
   - Card container: `relative z-10`
3) Place product image as a positioned element ABOVE the card:
   - Image wrapper: `absolute left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 -top-10 z-20`
   - Make it bigger on mobile:
     - img class like `w-[180px] sm:w-[220px]` (tune until it feels premium)
   - Keep the glow behind the image (your new glow), but ensure it is behind the image:
     - glow layer z-10, img z-20

CARD DESIGN (make it “engineered luxury”)
A) Card material
- Replace pill softness:
  - Card radius: `rounded-2xl`
  - Border: `border border-white/10`
  - Background: `bg-white/5` + optional `backdrop-blur-md`
  - Add subtle internal gradient:
    - use bg gradient: `bg-gradient-to-b from-white/8 to-white/3` (or equivalent)

B) Card spacing (reduce dead space, improve rhythm)
- Add top padding to account for the overlapping bottle:
  - `pt-16` (so content starts below the bottle)
- Normal padding:
  - `px-5 pb-5`

INFORMATION HIERARCHY (fix readability)
Inside the card, reorder into 5 clean blocks:

1) Micro label (small)
   - “MITOCHONDRIAL + GUT SIGNALING”
   - Use: text-white/60, tracking moderate (not huge), text-[11px]

2) Product name (dominant)
   - “CELLUBIOME”
   - Strong contrast, tight leading

3) One-line benefit (readable)
   - “Restores gut–mito signaling for sustained energy”
   - Make this 16px+, text-white/75

4) Outcomes (3 items max, tight)
   - Use a 2-column grid so it reads fast:
     wrapper: `grid grid-cols-2 gap-x-4 gap-y-2`
   - Each item: icon + label, no long lines
   - Increase contrast: text-white/70

5) Dosage + supply (two columns)
   - Left: “2 enteric-coated capsules daily”
   - Right: “30-day supply”
   - Use: `grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 text-[12px] text-white/60`
   - Add a thin divider line or subtle border-top above this block.

CTA DESIGN (make it premium and not confusing)
- Replace “VIEW PROTOCOL →” and “+ ADD TO STACK” with two clear buttons:
  - Primary: “View Protocol”
  - Secondary: “Add to Stack”
- Buttons should be engineered corners (no rounded-full):
  - `rounded-lg`
- Reduce height:
  - `py-3.5`
- Make primary higher contrast than secondary.
- Add subtle inner highlight to primary (not neon).

RESPONSIVE + POLISH RULES
- No element should overflow the card.
- No huge empty spaces. Keep vertical gaps to gap-3 / gap-4.
- Reduce excessive tracking everywhere (especially the trust/micro labels).
- The bottle must feel like it is “sitting” in the UI:
  - Add a faint shadow under it (in addition to the glow) so it’s grounded.
- Ensure tap targets are 44px minimum.

ACCEPTANCE TESTS (must pass)
1) On iPhone width, bottle is at least 25–35% larger than current and overlaps the card.
2) Card content starts below the bottle and is easy to scan in 3 seconds.
3) Outcomes are in a neat grid, not a wandering text block.
4) Buttons look premium (not pill, not cheap outline) and are not overly tall.
5) No weird dead space above/below the card.

DELIVERABLE
- Implement in the component that renders product cards.
- Tell me the file path and the exact classes you changed.
